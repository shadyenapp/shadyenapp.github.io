application that is secure from attack and has minimal risk it is essential that the application is developed in a secure manner. This involves using various lifecycles to guide the development process and models to simulate where the final application has a risk of attacks. Using key metrics and policies gives developers insight into whether the application is being developed securely and that they are doing a good job of securing it from threats. In conjunction with third-party tools for application security testing, this application security strategy is essential in guaranteeing that an application is secure throughout its life and deployment. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c32 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c3">Application Security Strategy</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Software Development Lifecycle</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When designing and developing an application it is vital that the application be developed and have security planned for at the beginning. The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is used to help facilitate and provide a path to develop applications. As shown in Figure 1, the SDLC starts off with the Planning and Analysis phase which is the most vital and pivotal phase of the SDLC, as shown in Figure 1. In this phase, the supervisors of the Exxon Software Security Team will work with the Exxon Board of Directors to plan the development of the application by making responsibility charts, managing a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), and making policies for the developers to ensure security during development. The second most important phase of the SDLC is the define and design phase, where the development team generates and curates a list of functional requirements, security requirements, metrics, and a Software Requirement Specification (SRS). Regarding the SDLC, functional requirements are specifiable requirements that detail what the program is supposed to do to complete its primary function, as well as any needs or requests from stakeholders. Contrarily, security requirements define what the program should not be able to do; to restrict the program&rsquo;s function to not expose common risks and vulnerabilities. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c11">Figure 1</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c11">The Software Development Lifecycle</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 279.16px; height: 293.23px;"><img alt="SDLC Diagram" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 279.16px; height: 293.23px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c11">Note</span><span class="c2">.

Using metrics enables developers to quantify a characteristic of a given system and relate, compare, and visualize against a set standard (Reid 2022). By using and measuring metrics the software development team can measure and gauge if the program needs any modification based on the gathered metrics. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Secure Software Development Lifecycle</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Even when a software development lifecycle is proposed and followed, there can be gaps and flaws in the security and functionality of the program. To mitigate these gaps, a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) should be chosen and followed in addition to the SDLC. By completing the activities and models in the different phases of the SSDLC, the benefits of both systems are used in conjunction with each other to ensure that the program is developed in a secure manner. There are many different types of SSDLCs, but almost all contain activities such as risk assessment, static analysis, dynamic analysis, response planning, and security review. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of&mdash;if not the most used SSDLCs&mdash;is the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (MSDL). As shown in Figure 2, the MSDL contains seven phases each with three main activities that ensure the program is secure during and after development. The most important of these activities include risk assessment, threat modeling, static testing, and dynamic testing. As such, during the development of the Exxon sensors VT235x-c and PSX25, the development team will follow an SDLC and the MSDL. By the end of the development lifecycle, the program will have gone through both systems and as such reduces the likelihood of common vulnerabilities. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c11">Figure 2</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c17 c11 c23">Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 151.20px;"><img alt="Simplified secure development lifecycle" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 151.20px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c11">Note</span><span class="c15">.

Catching common flaws by performing security practices early will dramatically cut costs in the development process, as when those flaws are left until later in the lifecycle, the development team will have to do steps over again. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed Chart</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important step before development begins on the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors, is that a Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) Chart must be made. A RACI chart provides clear and concise roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder and person involved in the development process. By utilizing a RACI chart, the development team will be able to know who is responsible for what tasks, as well as who should be consulted and informed of any progress regarding the tasks. This also ensures that development team leaders and stakeholders are informed of and consulted&mdash;depending on the task at hand.</span></p><p class="c13 c14"><span class="c3 c23 c17 c11">Table 1</span></p><a id="t.bbb5f2901bf1ac6044c6f297ebd30f49191a7f26"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c48"><tr class="c30"><td class="c4 c22" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span class="c10 c26">Task:</span></p></td><td class="c19 c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span class="c9">Board of Directors</span></p></td><td class="c4 c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span class="c9">Dev.

This table shows an example of a RACI chart that is used during a secure development process.

Ensuring that each task in each phase of the MSDL is completed and consulted by the people who need to, reduces the risk that any common vulnerability or flaw will make it to release. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Threat Modeling</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat modeling is the process of creating a model to simulate common attacks on a program to catch common vulnerabilities and risks. By creating models earlier in the development phase, the developers can spend more time and thought securing against common vulnerabilities as well as mitigating the vulnerabilities with the highest risk. Catching these vulnerabilities early saves money primarily by just saving the development team time in the testing phase, as they won&rsquo;t need to go back and fix errors that should have been caught earlier. Threat modeling is also a way of shifting developmental security to the left from where it is done in non-secure software development lifecycles. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STRIDE model focuses on determining the common attacks and common exploits on an application before development based on the predetermined security and functional requirements. The different threat categories the STRIDE model checks for are Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. A typical STRIDE model will show not only the elements of the infrastructure around the application but the applications&rsquo; interactions as well.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors, not only does the model need to incorporate the sensors&rsquo; code but also the connection to the databases, user accounts, web hosting, etc. The most essential elements and interactions to account for are the database, website, and sensor data collection program. As shown in Table 2, the STRIDE model shows areas, elements, and interactions where the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors are vulnerable to attack. The most common attack category for the sensors is Denial of Service (DOS) based attacks. In a DOS attack, the attacker overloads a service with requests with the goal of the service being unusable until dealt with. As shown by the model, an attacker can use a DOS attack to stop or inhibit the transfer of stored data, database queries, and requests to the sensors. For example, if an attacker can execute a DOS attack targeting the VT235x-c and PSX25, it would greatly hinder the ability of the supervisors to close or open valves. If unable to close or open a valve at a critical time, there would be lots of strain or damage to the physical architecture. To mitigate DOS attacks against the sensors&mdash;as well as other areas from the STRIDE model&mdash;the developers can implement a limit to how many requests are sent per second to 5, so the supervisors can still send large amounts of requests but not enough to impair the system. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c11">Table 2</span></p><a

class="c13"><span class="c15 c11">Note</span><span class="c2">. This STRIDE model shows the common vulnerability categories based on the STRIDE metric for the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors and their interactions with infrastructure. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Static and Dynamic Application Testing</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is the process of using outsourced tools to ensure that a program&rsquo;s code is secure and that it doesn&rsquo;t have any common vulnerabilities. SAST is performed in the development phase of the SDLC as it needs to often make changes and refactor the code&mdash;which is much easier and cheaper to do earlier in the lifecycle than later. Along with using third-party tools, at the end of the development phase, there is a code review, where an outside group of developers look through the code to find any common vulnerabilities than can be fixed. While this does increase costs to contract an outside group rather than having an in-house team look over the program&rsquo;s code, contracting a group allows developers who are unfamiliar with the code to review it, and thus can find vulnerabilities that in-house developers would assume are not there. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following SAST, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is used early in the testing phase of the SDLC. The primary goal of DAST is to set up testing environments where the application can be tested against common attacks. This way the application is tested against real attacks rather than just checking to see if the code has any vulnerabilities. Tools such as IBM AppScan and Invicti Netsparker set up virtual testing environments where common attacks are automatically tested and if any vulnerabilities are found, will generate a detailed report of the type of attack, how it was attacked, and how to mitigate the attack. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c3">Security Policies</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When developing secure code using an SSDLC like the MSDL, it is imperative that the developers and the program users are secure so that they are secure throughout the process. Security policies are enforceable rules that developers and administrators follow to maintain security. It is important that these policies are clear, easy to understand, and enforced, as when not followed it leaves the development team vulnerable to attacks. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Multi-Factor Authentication</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When accessing any data related to the program or using any company accounts, all the accounts must be secured using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA helps to ensure that when a login attempt is made, it is made by the appropriate person and not someone spoofing the account. Along with a password, an account secured with MFA will require users to prove that they have a device that only that person would have access to. For example, a common way MFA is implemented is by using personal cell phones so that when authorizing a login attempt, not only is a password required, but action on the phone is too. MFA needs to be enforced so that if an attacker breaches a password, they will not be able to log in and spoof an account without access to that account&rsquo;s MFA tool as well. Without this policy in place, the potential threat of account spoofing by unauthorized people expands exponentially, which can lead to a breach in sensitive data, code tampering, and the creation of backdoors. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Principle of Least Privilege</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The Principle of Least Privilege is the idea that users on a system should only have access to information and privileges that they need and nothing more. This ensures that users who are authorized to more information or require access to that information have it, while everyone else can&rsquo;t read or write to any of that data. When this policy is not enforced, there is the potential risk of unauthorized accounts accessing sensitive information, which increases the chance that the information is released&mdash;even if accidentally. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Set Coding Standards</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">When developing code, the developers must use and adhere to the predetermined coding style and standards provided by the head developer. Coding standards specify when and where to use comments, how to format data types, naming conventions for variables and functions, etc. Following this policy of using the coding standards, it ensures that every developer has a baseline knowledge of what the code does, rather than having to spend time trying to understand another developer&rsquo;s code choices. Not only does this save time and money by increasing productivity, but it also reduces the risk of vulnerabilities caused by developer oversight. When the developers don&rsquo;t adhere to a coding standard, mistakes and vulnerabilities can easily be overlooked by other developers who need to implement the code into the application.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Training</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Before being assigned a duty, developers need to have the training to be proficient in the programming language or operation that they are required to do. Even when a developer is proficient in other areas of expertise, if not proficient and knowledgeable about the specific setup Exxon uses, they can have oversights that lead to more risk. By not being familiar with the architecture or programming language assigned, the developers are more prone to risk not having that knowledge and experience. Thus, to be a part of the development team working on the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors, the developers must be trained and proficient in their duties. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Phishing Awareness</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a month during the development of the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors, the lead developers will send out decoy phishing emails. Though not having any malicious activity incorporated in the emails, this identifies the developers who need awareness training on phishing and its impacts. In their 2020 study, Cision found that upwards of 90 percent of all data breaches started from simple phishing attacks. By identifying who needs awareness training and requiring that training the development team is at a reduced risk of overall data breaches and attacks just by reducing the successful phishing attacks. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Testing Environments &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">When doing any sort of testing on the overall application, the testing must be done in a protected internal environment with no access to the outside internet. By making testing environments the development team can control every factor from virtual network architecture to simulated requests to simulate and test the application. However, it is a necessity that this testing is done in an environment or subnet with no access to the outside internet, as this ensures no risk of attacks while testing. If the developers tested the application out on the open internet, an attacker would likely exploit a part of the application that has no defenses before the developers have tested and provided remedies for the vulnerability. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3 c10">Metrics</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">All throughout the SDLC, metrics are essential in ensuring that the program is developed in a secure manner. By having quantifiable data that is measured while developing the code for the VT235x-c and PSX25, the development team can certify that the development process is secure and is working. Each metric can be measured in separate phases of the SDLC, with different people who need to be informed of the results, and different thresholds in place. A metric&rsquo;s threshold is the amount&mdash;or change in amount&mdash;measured that requires action to be maintained and secure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Key Metrics</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Surface.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;During the development cycle of the VT235x-c and PSX25, it is vital that the attack surface is measured closely, as that amount is a reliable indication of where the program is vulnerable. A program&rsquo;s attack surface is the number of places where the program takes user input or accesses files; anything that is accessed outside of the program&rsquo;s code. While the attack surface changes based on the functional requirements of the program, it is unnecessary to have a set amount threshold for the attack surface. Rather, the threshold for this metric is its change from reports. When the attack surface is reported, if it has changed by more than five since its last report, that would trigger the threshold prompting an investigation into what exactly each point of access is used for. This helps protect the program from injection in the development phase of the SDLC, as if an attacker were to add a backdoor (raising the attack surface) it would likely prompt an investigation leading to the removal of unnecessary points of entry. This metric also helps with oversight from the developers, as if there are ever errors and confusion causing more points of entry to be made than required, it would be found and dealt with before the testing phase. Even if entry points into a program are made without malicious intent, they can still be exploited when they are unknown to the testing team. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Lines of Code. </span><span class="c2">The lines of code in the program are another valuable metric to carefully watch and study during the development process for the VT235x-c and PSX25. Similar to the attack surface, the lines of code in a program are a volatile data source and as such its change over time is more important to measure. In the development process, it is usual and expected that the lines of code grow over time. However, when the number of lines increases more than usual, it can signify an injection. When the lines added to the code increase by 1.25 times the expected amount, it will trigger an investigation to ensure that the code written is expected to be there. Large additions to the code for a program are not uncommon, however, it is imperative that the development process is secure to develop a secure application. Additionally, if the lines of code in a program decrease by a small amount when committed or compiled, that would also be cause to look into what got removed. Whether it is malicious or not, it is important to discover what was removed and why as the removed code could impact the rest of the application, resulting in unexpected errors which can be exploited. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Libraries. </span><span class="c2">In the development of programs, outsourcing common functions to prewritten libraries is a common practice to save time, efficiency, and costs. Though the advantages are prominent it is vital that the development team keeps records of what libraries are used and where. Though this metric has no threshold to trigger a review in the development phase of the lifecycle, it is important that during testing and reviewing that the libraries used are checked for vulnerabilities. If the development team always has the assumption that the library they use is secure and always will be, that opens the door to possible vulnerabilities. Keeping a record of what libraries are used in which functions of the program and why increases the capability of an incident response plan working if one of the libraries has an exploit. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaw Reporting. </span><span class="c2">In the process of developing a secure application, there will be occurrences where errors in the code arise or there are discrepancies in the coding standards, there needs to be a way to report such problems. Similar to the libraries used, there is no direct metric that can cause a threshold to trigger a response, rather it needs to be completed during the planning phase of the SDLC. If there is ever a point in the development lifecycle that developers don&rsquo;t know or aren&rsquo;t familiar with the process of reporting security flaws, then the current process needs to be updated and the developers need to be informed about the process. When the process of reporting flaws is unknown by the developers working on a project it increases the odds that a flaw goes unreported that can be exploited after deployment. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network Access. </span><span class="c2">In an application that requires connection to the internal as well as external network, the points of network access and why need to be measured and reported. If the amount of network access the application has grows or shrinks at all in the development process that would trigger a threshold that requires investigation into what was added or removed. The amount of network access is similar to the attack surface in that the more network access the application has, increases the number of places an attacker can exploit. By monitoring and reporting the application&rsquo;s access to the network, the development team can ensure that there are no points of access that are there accidentally or put in with malicious intent. Along with keeping minimal network access, the reasons for the network access need to be reported as well, so that if there is something that is using network access that can function without it, it is changed before deployment. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Metric Dashboard</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">In order to properly view, maintain, and track metrics over time, it is vital that there is an online dashboard where any member of the development team can view the current gathered metrics. An example representation of a metric dashboard is shown in Figure 3 using the metrics specified above. This shows metrics such as lines of code over time and current libraries but also makes the flaw-reporting process easy to understand and easy to locate. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c23 c17 c11">Figure 3</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.93px;"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text

As this tool suite requires the application to be running, IBM AppScan is best used in the early testing phase of the SDLC and thus does not examine any part of the source code. As such, this type of testing can help identify vulnerabilities with attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, improper error handling, unhandled exceptions, and more. In its description, IBM states that AppScan can, &ldquo;provide a deep application security assessment using a number of unique capabilities, including smart Cross-Site Scripting analysis and hybrid analysis of client-side JavaScript&rdquo; (IBM, 2019). AppScan will also show the developers all the different requests it makes to the web application so that the developers can see everything AppScan tests for when completing the scan. When looking into the results of the scan, AppScan will show the developers different nodes from the website and state what issues were found, how many issues there are, as well as remedies for how to start implementing fixes for the app. When a developer needs more information on issues that AppScan found while testing, AppScan will easily show the severity of each issue to set a priority list of what to work on first. Along with the priority list, AppScan will also show developers example simulations of what the issue is on their site, along with what information users can get that they wouldn&rsquo;t normally. The most extensive part of AppScan is its ability to generate formal and well-documented reports that are &ldquo;Industry standard and regulatory compliant&rdquo; (Proya, 2016) that include every issue, simulation, and remedy for the issue. While this tool does provide a lot of checks and tests for common vulnerabilities and threats in applications, as IBM AppScan is deployed in the early testing phase, the vulnerabilities caught will cost more to fix compared to if they were caught in development. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c3">Invicti Netsparker</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The major competitor to IBM AppScan is Invicti Netsparker. Netsparker not only sets up a dynamic testing environment, but it also reports almost no false positives and captures every vulnerability in its database. As shown in Figure 4, Invicti Netsparker detects more vulnerabilities than AppScan but also reports a higher volume of vulnerabilities in the categories that AppScan lacks. Netsparker also uses an intuitive dashboard to plot data from the entirety of the development process, which makes reviewing the process easier. One of Netsparker&rsquo;s most crucial aspects is that it can schedule automated scans of the application to check for vulnerabilities. This is important as in the development process, it is not only essential to check the code that is being written, but also how that code interacts with the code that has already been written. By setting up automatic scans throughout the process before the testing phase of the SDLC, the development team can catch vulnerabilities as early as they can. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c23 c17 c11">Figure 4</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c23 c17 c11">Invicti Netsparker detection results</span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 587.00px; height: 144.30px;"><img alt="A picture containing graphical user interface

This is useful to do before starting final development as&mdash;along with threat modeling&mdash;gets the developers and stakeholders a new way to propose thoughts and concerns with a shared ground in mind. This ensures that the developers make a program with all of the functionality and requirements that the contractors request, as well as making sure to develop it in a secure manner. The model for the sensors (see appendix) has been written in Fortran 90, as it is a low-level programming language and thus doesn&rsquo;t need an interpreter or as many resources to run. This ensures that no matter the hardware requirements of the physical sensors, gathering and reading the data will be able to run efficiently. This model has abstraction over what will be the final result, and as such, data is stored in a comma-separated file (CSV) and the generated data is randomized. Though the model does not use actual data, databases, or websites, it still offers hosts of insight into how the program is developed securely. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running the main program to gather and generate data of the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors will produce a dataset as shown in figure 5.

A common attack in situations such as this would be to input data that is of the wrong data type or data that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in the specified set. Regarding the sensors, if the user inputs a character or any number less than zero, the program will not continue, as shown:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">1 &nbsp;DO</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT *, &quot;Enter a Sensor ID: &quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;READ(*,*, IOSTAT=staterror) intid</span></p><p class="c18 c37"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;4 &nbsp; &nbsp;IF ( staterror == 0 ) THEN</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EXIT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6 &nbsp; &nbsp;END IF</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7 &nbsp; &nbsp;IF ( intid &lt;= 0 ) THEN</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EXIT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; &nbsp;END IF</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; PRINT *, &quot;Invalid input try again&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 END DO</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The do loop handles unwanted input and doesn&rsquo;t let the program continue unless a correct input is identified. On line 2 of the code snippet, the program prompts the user for a sensor ID. Line 3 accepts the input, but importantly makes a note of the error value from the input as well as choosing an integer to store the data to. This is so that if a non-integer value is inputted, the read statement would error, and the do loop repeats itself until an input is accepted. Even when the user input is of the specified type, it could not make sense regarding functionality, and thus would cause errors later in the program. In this case, there will never exist a sensor with an ID zero or lower, and as such the program will only complete if the user inputs a number above zero.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Error Handling. </span><span class="c2">When a program enters an unexpected state or receives unexpected data from a user, it can generate errors that can potentially reveal information about the program to attackers. The internal structure of the program and specific information from the errors gives attackers a better understanding of what they can exploit in the program. To mitigate this, proper error handling is used. Proper error handling catches any unexpected state or input to then display an error message that gives minimal information and avoids crashes. By giving the user a minimal error message, it provides less information that can be used against the program while still providing information to developers on what went wrong. Error handling has been incorporated into the model as shown:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 &nbsp; &nbsp;READ(*,*, IOSTAT=staterror) intid</span></p><p class="c18 c37"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp;IF ( staterror == 0 ) THEN</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EXIT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4 &nbsp; &nbsp;END IF</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Fortran 90 is a low-level programming language, it does not have access to &lsquo;try&rsquo; and &lsquo;except&rsquo; functions a higher-level programming language&mdash;such as C++ or Java&mdash;would. Rather, Fortran relies on error codes generated from each statement, as shown in line 1. The IOSTAT (error code) is captured and stored in the &ldquo;staterror&rdquo; variable rather than being acted upon. If the IOSTAT was not captured, the program would crash and return an error statement. However, as it is captured, it can then be checked against error codes (as shown in line 2). In this specific case, the program checks if the error code is error code 0, which in Fortran signifies a successful operation, and thus will continue. When the error code is not 0 rather than crashing, the program continues until it reaches a successful operation. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injection. </span><span class="c15">As the model was developed using this application security strategy, there is no risk of injection attacks. The two programs to generate and read the data were made following the SDLC and SSDLC in conjunction with the metrics stated above. The lines of code were monitored, so there is no risk of a foreign code in the program that is not supposed to be there. There is also no risk to input injection, as the programs only allow an integer to be inputted and will not accept anything else. However, in the final product, there still must be some activities performed to mitigate injection-based attacks. A major area susceptible to attack is the web page where team members can log on to see the data generated by the VT235x-c or PSX25. An attacker can try an enter values that the system reads as commands rather than text. A successful mitigation strategy for this type of attack is to blacklist certain characters from being accepted as input, such as quotation marks, forward slashes, backslashes, tildes, parenthesis, commas, periods, and any mathematical symbol. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privilege Escalation. </span><span class="c2">While extremely minimal in the model, privilege escalation is an extremely important area of attack and as such needs strong mitigation strategies to prevent it. Privilege Escalation occurs when a user account on the system gains access to files or information that the user account does not have authority to access. The main mitigation strategy to prevent privilege escalation is to follow password policies and the principle of least privilege. By following password policies such as enabling MFA, heavily decreases the ability for an attacker to use an administrator account to access protected files. Along with password policies, by following the principle of least privilege, it ensures that there is no sensitive data is available to everyone, even if accidental. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c3">Audit</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the model for the program is sufficient for what it is, a more effective and insightful model would be made and tested on models of the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensors. The model should also have included models of the web application and database so that there is more data to gather on what kind of attacks can be done on the model rather than just using the STRIDE model. As well more of the STRIDE model should have been incorporated into the model sensors, as things such as data encryption, login authentication, and database request authentication are absent in the model. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c3">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This application security plan is detailed and sufficient in ensuring that the VT235x-c and PSX25 sensor applications are developed in a secure manner to ensure a secure application before deployment. It incorporates Software Development Lifecycles as well as Secure Software Development Lifecycles to use as a roadmap of what the developers need to focus on and when. This application security plan also relies on gathered metrics and policies to make sure that the application is developed securely and that there is no risk of attacks during development. This strategy also uses threat models and models of the final application to gather more data on attack surfaces and what can be vulnerable to ensure that the application is secure at deployment after enduring a secure development lifecycle. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c32 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c34 c14"><span class="c10 c3">References</span></p><p class="c13 c14"><span class="c15">Cision.
